# **1\. Welcome Email (New Client)**

Subject: _Welcome - Let's Build Your Success System_

Hi \[Name\],

Welcome to the Plurapreneur® ecosystem - where your life, your brand, and your business start moving as one integrated engine.

Before we begin, I want you to take one breath and say this:

**"My success has a system."**

Because it does.  
And we're about to unlock it.

Here's what I need from you:

- Your top 3 goals
- Your biggest current blocker
- What "success" looks like for you

Reply with whatever comes to your heart first. Don't overthink it - clarity comes _through_ the process, not before it.

We're in motion.  

- Coach Daymond

# **3\. Boundary Email (Clear Expectations With Love)**

Subject: _Let's Align Your Needs + Priorities_

Hi \[Name\],

I appreciate your transparency. I want us to operate with clarity - on your goals, your budget, and your priorities.

Before we continue, I need you to define:

- What you need from me
- Your realistic investment level
- Your top priority right now

Once you identify those, I can help you with precision.  
I don't want us running in circles - I want us running with intention.

Take your time.

# **4\. Motivational Check-In Email**

Subject: _I See You Moving_

Hey \[Name\],

Just checking in - I see the growth in your decisions, your discipline, and your direction.

You're not the same person you were even 30 days ago.  
That's what happens when you stop surviving and start designing.

Keep going.
