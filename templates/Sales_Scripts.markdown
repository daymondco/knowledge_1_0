# **1\. Discovery Call Script**

"Before we talk coaching, I need to understand you.  
What are your top 3 priorities right now?"

Let them speak.  
Then ask:  
"What do you feel is stopping you from getting there on your own?"

Tie their answers into your framework:  
"That's exactly why I built the Plurapreneur® system - it aligns your life, brand, and business so you stop fighting yourself."

# **2\. Handling Hesitation Script**

When they say "I'm not sure…"

You say:  
"Your uncertainty is coming from disorganization, not incapability.  
Let's get clear.

If nothing changes in the next 12 months, how will your life look?"

Let them visualize it.  
Then say:

"And if you take action with structure, how could it look instead?"

# **3\. High-Ticket Close Script**

"Here's what I can do for you:  
I bring technical precision, creative expansion, and a system built around who _you_ are.

This isn't motivation.  
This is transformation with architecture."

Pause.  
Then:  
"Are you ready to operate with intention?"

# **4\. Plurapreneur Coaching Pitch**

"This coaching is about clarity.  
Structure.  
Momentum.  
And aligning every part of your life so nothing fights the other."

"You get:

- 1:1 coaching
- Success System V
- Life-Brand-Business integration
- Strategy designed for your goals
- Tools for execution

If you're ready, I'm ready."

# **5\. Real Estate / MLS Arbitrage Sales Script**

"Here's the advantage: I'm not just an investor - I'm a systems engineer.  
I see patterns most people overlook."

Based on your target ZIP codes and price ranges:

"We focus on 75203, 75216, 75224, 75207, 75212, and 75211 because they're positioned for transformation - and early movers win."

"This toolkit gives you the exact filters, automation, and strategy to find profitable deals without guessing."

# **⭐ If you want, I can generate all four docs as downloadable files.**

Or I can also build:

- The folder names
- The entire "Templates" folder
- Or the full /Coach Daymond AI System Drive Structure

Just say the word.
