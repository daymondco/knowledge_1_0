# **Success System V™ Framework**

_A Plurapreneur® Methodology for Achieving Authentic, Repeatable Success  
_**Author:** Coach Daymond E. Lavine © Daymond E. Lavine  
**Source:** _A SIMPLE Systems Engineering Success_

## **Overview**

The **Success System V™** is a structured, repeatable, systems-engineering-inspired personal development model created by Coach Daymond E. Lavine. It is a two-part V-model process that guides individuals through the full lifecycle of achieving a SMART goal-from initial conception to final realization.

The framework is built on the principle that **success is engineered**, not accidental. When a person defines their intentions clearly and follows a disciplined, iterative roadmap, they can produce consistent, aligned, and meaningful results in any area of life.

The V-model contains **eight (8) total activities,** split evenly across two phases:

- **Left Side of the V:** _Project Definition & Decomposition_
- **Right Side of the V:** _Problem Assessment & Minimization_

This dual-sided structure keeps the individual grounded in vision while also ensuring they address obstacles, optimize performance, and confirm alignment between desired outcomes and actual results.

# **PART I - PROJECT DEFINITION & DECOMPOSITION**

_The Left Side of the V  
_This phase focuses on designing, defining, and preparing for success. It is where vision is created, clarified, and decomposed into actionable components.

### **1\. Conceive Your Success**

Define your ultimate desire or end-state vision. This is where you determine what "success" truly means for you-independent of external influence.  
**Outputs:** Vision statement, emotional drivers, high-level intentions.

### **2\. Plan Your Success**

Translate the vision into a structural plan. Develop your approach, gather necessary resources, identify constraints, and decide how you will move forward.  
**Outputs:** Strategy, initial roadmap, resource assessment, SMART goals.

### **3\. Define Your Success**

Break the plan into detailed, manageable requirements. Define specific objectives, metrics, expectations, and quality standards for the goal.  
**Outputs:** Success requirements, acceptance criteria, metrics for performance.

### **4\. Build Your Success**

Begin implementing the system. Execute the tasks, behaviors, habits, and routines required to build progress toward your goals.  
**Outputs:** Executed actions, created assets, implemented behaviors, first functional version of your results.

# **PART II - PROBLEM ASSESSMENT & MINIMIZATION**

_The Right Side of the V  
_This phase ensures that the vision is aligned with reality. It focuses on evaluation, correction, confirmation, and real-world validation.

### **5\. Test Your Success**

Evaluate the work performed thus far. Check whether your behaviors, systems, and outputs are functioning as expected.  
**Outputs:** Test results, insights, first-level adjustments.

### **6\. Verify Your Success**

Confirm that your work meets the requirements defined earlier. Verification ensures the internal integrity of your goal system.  
**Outputs:** Verified requirements, confirmed progress, alignment checklist.

### **7\. Validate Your Success**

Validate that the outcome aligns with your original vision and authentic desires. Validation checks that the result "feels right" and fulfills your intended purpose.  
**Outputs:** Validated purpose, emotional fit, alignment confirmation.

### **8\. Actualize Your Success**

Implement the final version of your success and integrate it into your life. This is where the goal becomes a lived experience, not just a plan or aspiration.  
**Outputs:** Completed success, embedded habits, sustainable results.

# **Core Purpose of the Success System V™**

The Success System V™ ensures that any individual can achieve consistent success by following a structured, repeatable system. This method is designed to be:

- **Universal** - applicable to any SMART goal, personal or professional.
- **Authenticity-Aligned** - centered on the individual's true desires, not societal expectations.
- **Systems-Driven** - built on engineering discipline, eliminating randomness.
- **Growth-Oriented** - integrates learning, correction, and continuous improvement.

When followed thoroughly, this system provides a reliable framework for achieving major life goals while maintaining full clarity, alignment, and confidence.
