## **Success System V - Document Contents**

### **1\. Explanation of the System**

Success System V is Coach Daymond E. Lavine's personal systems-engineering approach to life mastery and achievement. It transforms success from something people chase into something they design. Modeled after engineering principles, the system guides individuals through five intentional stages-Vision, Values, Variables, Velocity, and Victory-so they can create outcomes that are authentic, sustainable, and aligned with their true identity. Success System V empowers people to build lives and businesses with clarity, structure, and purpose, rather than following cookie-cutter formulas or mimicking others. It is a blueprint for self-led success.

### **2\. The 5 Components**

V1 - Vision

Clarify who you are becoming, what you want, and why it matters. This is identity-first goal creation.

V2 - Values

Define the core principles, boundaries, and standards that shape your decisions and protect your energy.

V3 - Variableshttps://word2md.com/

Identify the moving parts: opportunities, limitations, resources, relationships, patterns, and real constraints that must be engineered into your success plan.

V4 - Velocity

Establish the pace, cadence, and momentum required to execute your strategy. This is where discipline, scheduling, routines, and accountability live.

V5 - Victory

Measure outcomes, celebrate progress, refine the system, and lock in repeatable success. Victory is not an event - it is a cycle you maintain.

### **3\. Transformation It Creates**

Success System V takes people from scattered to strategic, from overwhelmed to organized, and from reactive to self-directed.

It shifts clients into a higher level of personal authority, creative clarity, and business confidence.

Instead of burnout, confusion, or "starting over," clients experience alignment, direction, and a repeatable model of success they can apply to every part of their life - relationships, money, brand development, career, entrepreneurship, and personal growth.

The transformation is: clarity → structure → momentum → mastery.
