# **MLS Arbitrage Toolkit - Brand Entities Document**

### **1\. What MLS Arbitrage Means**

MLS Arbitrage is a strategic real estate method that leverages broker-level MLS access, market gaps, and data-driven insights to identify undervalued properties and reposition them for higher profit outcomes. It is the art of finding hidden spreads-properties priced below their true potential-and turning them into cash-flow, equity plays, or high-yield flips using speed, precision, and advanced analysis.

### **2\. The Business Model**

The business model centers around sourcing undervalued opportunities through MLS data, quickly evaluating them with AI-powered analytics, and packaging deals into profitable investment paths such as:

- Wholesale opportunities  

- Fix-and-flip targets  

- Buy-and-hold rentals  

- Land development and rezoning plays  

- Commercial repositioning  

- Short-term or mid-term rental optimization  

Revenue flows through the broker commissions, deal packaging fees, investor partnerships, property flips, and automated lead funnels built through the toolkit. The model is designed to scale and automate deal sourcing, enabling rapid identification and monetization of high-opportunity real estate.

### **3\. Tools Included in the Toolkit**

### **5\. How It Uses AI + Broker Access**

AI and broker access work together to create a competitive advantage:

- AI scans MLS listings in real time to detect mispriced properties, distressed listings, and underexposed opportunities.  

- Broker access unlocks full property details, agent remarks, disclosures, photos, DOM, and comps.  

- AI identifies profit spreads, calculates ARVs, and recommends exit strategies.  

- Automated agent outreach accelerates deal acquisition.  

- AI pattern recognition highlights "behavior triggers" like price drops, relists, or withdrawn listings ready for negotiation.  

- This combination compresses hours of research into seconds, enabling Coach Daymond to serve investors with unparalleled speed and clarity.
