The Brentwood Trinity Heights Community Action Group (BTHCAG) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to elevating the quality of life for residents in District #4 through infrastructure improvements, safer neighborhoods, economic development, and strong community advocacy. The mission centers on empowering residents to use their collective voice to influence policy, hold leaders accountable, and build a thriving, connected community.

### **2\. District #4 Focus**

BTHCAG focuses specifically on neighborhoods within Dallas City Council District #4, including Brentwood, Trinity Heights, and surrounding adjacent communities. The organization prioritizes issues that directly impact residents' daily lives-streets, lighting, sidewalks, parks, drainage, traffic safety, economic revitalization, and small-business empowerment-ensuring District #4 receives equitable investment and attention.

### **3\. Types of Initiatives**

BTHCAG leads and supports initiatives that strengthen the community, including:

- Infrastructure advocacy (streets, sidewalks, lighting, drainage, traffic calming)  

- Park and public space development, including Halperin Park and other recreational improvements  

- Neighborhood safety actions, including crime reporting mobilization and vice-activity documentation  

- Small business empowerment, including the Neighborly Business Exchange and community-led economic growth  

- Public accountability campaigns, applying pressure to city leadership when necessary  

- Community cleanups, beautification, and revitalization events  

- Workshops, resource sessions, and information sharing  

### **4\. Community Concerns (Infrastructure, Parks, Vice Reporting, etc.)**

BTHCAG actively addresses the following core community concerns:

- Poor infrastructure: damaged roads, missing sidewalks, drainage failures, outdated lighting  

- Park development: need for safe trails, playgrounds, green spaces, and amenities at Halperin Park and other locations  

- Crime and vice activity: prostitution corridors, illegal drug activity, nuisance houses, high-traffic problem areas  

- Lack of government response: delayed repairs, ignored complaints, or lack of transparency  

- Economic stagnation: limited retail, few new developments benefiting residents  

- Neglected public spaces: trash, overgrowth, unsafe bus stops, abandoned properties  

- Property tax concerns: ensuring residents know about exemptions and protections  

BTHCAG meets these concerns with data gathering, public documentation, and strategic escalation to leadership.

### **6\. Campaign Names:**

BTHCAG uses bold, memorable campaign names to mobilize residents and apply strategic pressure when necessary. These campaigns reflect urgency, unity, and power. Examples include:

- Turn It Up In The Streets  

- Turn Up The Heat  

- Additional campaigns used as needed for visibility and impact  

### **7\. Turn It Up In The Streets**

A community-mobilization campaign that activates residents to document infrastructure issues, crime hot spots, and neglected areas-then collectively submit them to leadership. The campaign's purpose is to raise visibility, increase pressure, and make community concerns impossible for the city to ignore.

This initiative leverages the belief that when many voices speak at once, the city must respond.

### **8\. Turn Up The Heat**

A higher-intensity accountability campaign focused on public pressure. It is deployed when issues have been ignored for too long or when urgent responsiveness is needed.

Turn Up The Heat uses repeated documentation, public posting, multiple-channel reporting, and escalation to top officials to demand attention and accelerate results.

### **• Strategy You Use (Public Accountability + Government Pressure)**

BTHCAG leverages a dual-strategy model rooted in transparency and strategic pressure:

- Public Accountability  
  - Publishing issues openly  

  - Documenting photos, videos, timestamps, and patterns  

  - Sharing concerns with residents and officials simultaneously  

  - Creating urgency through community visibility  

- Government Pressure  
  - Sending reports to all relevant city departments  

  - CC'ing multiple levels of leadership to prevent issues from being buried  

  - Repeating reports until responses occur  

  - Using public forums, events, and social media to push for action  

  - Highlighting wins to reinforce progress and keep momentum high  

This strategy works because it creates both public awareness and political incentive, making inaction costly and responsiveness rewarding.
